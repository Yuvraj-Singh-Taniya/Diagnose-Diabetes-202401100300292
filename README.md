# Diagnose-Diabetes-202401100300292
Overview
This project aims to predict whether an individual is likely to develop diabetes based on medical records. Using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, we train a Logistic Regression model to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.

Dataset
Source: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)

Features: Includes attributes like glucose, blood pressure, BMI, age, and a diabetes outcome indicator.

Target: "Outcome" (1: Diabetic, 0: Non-diabetic)

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Load the dataset, handle missing values, split into training and test sets, and standardize features.

Model: Logistic Regression is used to predict diabetes.

Evaluation: Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix are calculated and visualized.

Requirements
Python libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn.

Install via pip: pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn.

Running the Project
Clone/download the repo.

Place the dataset (2. Diagnose Diabetes.csv) in the same folder as the notebook.

Run the notebook (Diabetes Diagnosis.ipynb) in Jupyter or compatible environment to execute the analysis.

Results
The model's performance is evaluated using confusion matrix and classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
